# EXCERPT FROM PAPER
# The action and reaction networks reach > 99% and 85.8% validation accuracy, respectively.
# The first reactant network, frt1, with a validation accuracy of only 30.8% after k-NN retrieval.
# To compare, frt2 reaches a validation accuracy of 70.0% without masking out invalid actions.
