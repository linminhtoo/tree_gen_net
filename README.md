# how to run
## data preparation
Please run all the scripts in `tree_gen_net/bash_scripts/` following the numerical order from 1 to 10. The necessary input data has been included. Rough timing benchmarks have also been included. Some routines run much faster on multiprocessing.

## training
Please run the 4 scripts in `tree_gen_net/train/`, each named after the model they train. Alternatively, you can just run `bash tree_gen_net/train/train_all.sh`.

## inference
For synthesis planning, please run `bash tree_gen_net/train/decode_trees.sh`, which decodes synthetic trees greedily (k=1) conditional on product SMILES in the test set trees. Afterwards, please run `bash tree_gen_net/train/calc_simil.sh` to calculate the pairwise Tanimoto similarity of the decoded SMILES versus those product SMILES in the test set trees.

For property optimization via genetic algorithm, please run `bash tree_gen_net/train/genetic_algorithm.sh`

Of course, the arguments in all of these scripts can be modified and experimented with. None of the code is hardcoded and should be quite flexible. Currently, I have used either the settings from the paper, or otherwise scaled down some hyperparameters just to get working prototype out as fast as possible, given I have only spent 2 weekends (aka roughly 3-4 man days) on this project.
