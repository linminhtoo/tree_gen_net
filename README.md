# (Reimplementation) Amortized Tree Generation for Bottom-up Synthesis Planning and Synthesizable Molecular Design 
https://openreview.net/forum?id=FRxhHdnxt1 

# setup (conda environment)
```
# init conda, such as by activating .bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

conda create -n tree python=3.6 pip
conda activate tree

# rdkit can only be installed via conda, not pip
conda install -c rdkit rdkit -y

/path/to/conda/env/tree/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# how to run
## data preparation
Please run all the scripts in `tree_gen_net/bash_scripts/data_prep/` following the numerical order from 1 to 10. The necessary input data has been included, obtained by following the paper. Rough timing benchmarks have also been included. Some routines run much faster on multiprocessing.

## training
Please run the 4 scripts in `tree_gen_net/bash_scripts/train/`, each named after the model they train. Alternatively, you can just run `bash tree_gen_net/bash_scripts/train/train_all.sh`.

## inference
For synthesis planning, please run `bash tree_gen_net/bash_scripts/test/decode_trees.sh`, which decodes synthetic trees greedily (k=1) conditional on product SMILES in the test set trees. Afterwards, please run `bash tree_gen_net/bash_scripts/test/calc_simil.sh` to calculate the pairwise Tanimoto similarity of the decoded SMILES versus those product SMILES in the test set trees.

For property optimization via genetic algorithm, please run `bash tree_gen_net/bash_scripts/test/genetic_algorithm.sh`

Of course, the arguments in all of these scripts can be modified and experimented with. None of the code is hardcoded and should be quite flexible. Currently, I have used either the settings from the paper, or otherwise scaled down some hyperparameters just to get working prototype out as fast as possible, given I have only spent 2 weekends (aka roughly 3-4 man days) on this project.

# potential next steps
- future experiments
    - experimental validation
    - filtering training trees by property of interest (property-biased neural networks)
    - analogue generation on best molecules from genetic algorithm, hope the analogues also have high property of interest
- unit tests
